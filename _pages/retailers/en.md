The Poppy project makes amazing open source technologies.  
Unfortunately, it is not possible to get the hardware for free... Therefore, _Poppy_ was trademarked to ensure quality control at all levels, to ensure that users ordering products with the Poppy trademark get high quality material and services that respect the values of the project.

Here you will find official distributors who understand the open values of Poppy and are striving to help community members by providing high quality products within optimized prices.
