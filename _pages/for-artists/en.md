  Robotic objects can be used as tools to formulate and explore questions in the artistic domain.<br>
  The Poppy platform provides modular building blocks that artists can use and hack, with the support of an interdisciplinary community sharing technical and conceptual knowledge.

## How can I use the Poppy platform?

Poppy is an open-source modular platform based on simple and robust technology, which can be hacked by non-technicians, opening the way to new avenues for creation.

The platform is based on [technological bricks]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang }}/technologies) allowing the creation of novel robotic shapes or behaviours. It also includes examples of full creatures like the [Poppy Humanoid]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang }}/robots/poppy-humanoid), or the [Poppy Ergo Jr]({{ site.baseurl }}/{{ page.lang }}/robots/poppy-ergo-jr), which can directly be reused or modified for artistic purposes.

      Modify the morphology of existing Poppy creatures to give them a new meaning.

      Use the technological bricks to invent an entirely new creature, and share it with the community!
