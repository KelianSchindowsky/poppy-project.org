<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Originally designed in the <a href="https://flowers.inria.fr/robots/ergo-robots/">"Mathematics: a beautiful elsewhere"</a> artistic experiment, the Ergo Jr has been adapted to fit with education needs.</p>

<p>It is a robotic arm, consisting of 6 motors allowing life-like movements and 3D printed elements. The use of rivets make the assembly, modification and reassembly easy. Ergo Jr comes with three tools for different interactions with its environment: a lampshade, a gripper and a pen holder.</p>

<p>The robot is controlled with a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> board, and a camera helps it interact with the world.</p>

<p>Everything in the robot is let transparent and accessible to promote an educative approach and an interactive technology.</p>

<h2>Program Ergo Jr</h2>

<p>Ergo Jr relies on <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu">Snap!</a>, a variant of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, the visual programming language. Its accessibility and efficiency make it a great tool to discover robotics and understand the digital world. It can be used directly on the robot with no additional installation.</p>

<p>It comes with a set of pedagogical activities, developed with high-school teachers, ranging from the discovery of the robot and how to control it to more complex and integrated project. These activities are accessible for free on <a href="https://forum.poppy-project.org/tags/c/education/pedagogical-activities/ergo-jr">the project's forums</a>.</p>
