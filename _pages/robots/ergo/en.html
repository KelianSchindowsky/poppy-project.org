<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Originally designed in the <a href="https://flowers.inria.fr/robots/ergo-robots/">"Mathematics a beautiful elsewhere"</a> artistic experiment, the Ergo Jr has been adapted to fit with education needs.</p>

<p>It is a robotic arm, made of 6 motors allowing for life-like movements. The pieces are 3D printed. Thanks to the use of rivets they can be assembled, modified, and reassembled with ease. Ergo Jr comes with three tools - a lampshade, a gripper and a pen holder - permitting the realisation of various projects. </p>

<p>We use a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry-Pi</a> board for control and add a camera so the robot can interact with the world.</p>

<p>We promote an educative approach and an interactive technology. We let everything transparent and accessible.</p>

<h2>Program your robot</h2>

<p>Ergo Jr relies on <a href="http://snap.berkeley.edu">Snap!</a> a variant of <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">scratch</a> the visual programming language. Its accessibility and efficiency make it a great tool to discover robotics and understand the digital world. You can use it directly on the robot and do not need to install anything.</p>

<p>It comes with a set of pedagogical activies, developed with high-school teachers, ranging from the discovery of the robot and how to control it to more complex and integrated project. They can be accessed <a href="https://forum.poppy-project.org/tags/c/education/pedagogical-activities/ergo-jr">here</a>. Some examples can be seen in the videos below:</p>
