<p class="lead">Poppy Torso is a variation of the <a href="/en/robots/poppy-humanoid">Poppy Humanoid</a> robot. It is an open-source humanoid robot torso which can be installed easily on tabletops. More affordable than the Poppy Humanoid, it is an ideal medium to learn science, technology, engineering and mathematics.
</p>

<p>Like Poppy Humanoid, Poppy Torso is an open-source robot (both hardware and software), using 3D printed parts and Dynamixel servomotors, known for their reliability.</p>

<p>The torso is attached to a suction pad with lever arm to ensure the utmost stability. The suction pad and the fastening nuts are included in this kit.</p>

<h2>Visual programming</h2>

<p>Poppy Torso can be programmed using web-visual programming tools such as Snap!, a variation of Scratch.<br>
Snap! allows rich event-based concurrent programming. It also allows beginners to discover programming, or artists to program interactive behaviors.</p>

<h2>Student project example</h2>

<p>Beyond learning programming and mechatronics, Poppy Torso can be used in learning to design human-machine interaction, such as in assistive robotics projects. The <a href="{{ site.data.links.cherry_project }}">Cherry Project</a> is such a successful example, where a group of students explored how to use Poppy Torso to assist children in hospitals.</p>
