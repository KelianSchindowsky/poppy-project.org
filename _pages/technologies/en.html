    The Poppy project develops open-source tools for rapid prototyping and
    flexible experimentation of robotic creatures. It addresses mechanics,
    electronics, and software.
  </p>
  <p>
    We are a multidisciplinary community of researchers,
    teachers, artists, and robotic enthusiasts that share their work and ideas.<br>
    Poppy tools are designed to be modular, easy to use and integrate – providing building blocks simple to assemble and reconfigure.

      <h3>Poppy Humanoid</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        Poppy Humanoid is our leading creature. It is aesthetic, modular,
        and parametric. From a single arm to the complete humanoid, this
        platform is actively used in labs, engineering schools, FabLabs, and
        artistic projects.

      <h3>Poppy Torso</h3>
    </a>
      <p>
        Poppy Torso is an humanoid robot torso meant to be used in contexts
        such as education, FabLabs or research projects.

      <h3>Poppy Ergo Jr</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        Poppy Ergo Jr was first developed for an exhibition mixing art and
        science. With only 6 motors it is the perfect project to start.

  <h2>Modular technologies</h2>

  <h3>Hardware</h3>

  <p>
    Our main concern is to provide robotic technologies that are cheap and modular. We want robotics to become click-and-play, changing robots' morphologies as projects evolve. As much as possible, we aim at using off the shelf and popular technologies.
  </p>
  <p>
    All our work is open source and distributed under Creative Commons BY-SA licenses.
  </p>

  <h3>3D printed bodies</h3>

  <p>
    Poppy creatures are 3D printed – it is a reproducible and cheap production technique that allows anyone to produce locally its own and customized parts. It also allows for a wider range of possible design by removing manufacturing constraints from mass production methods.
  </p>

  <h3>Modular actuation</h3>

  <p>
    Poppy creatures are based on modular smart-actuators branded Robotis Dynamixel. Within a small form factor, these motors embed high-precision monitoring and controland are synchronized on a shared communication and power line. They are commonly used in robotics and comes in multiple actuation power. Them being quite expensive motors, we are constantly looking for alternatives and contribution are very much welcomed.
  </p>

  <h3>Arduino</h3>

  <p>
    We develop custom electronic board optimized for robotics needs. We want you
    to be able to add motors and sensors where you want. As a first step, we
    developed an Arduino compatible board; it features plenty of I/O and benefits
    from the Arduino community, but also includes new features, such as a USB HUB
    and the elements needed to control Dynamixel servos.
  </p>

  <h3>Software overview</h3>

  <p>
     Easy-to-use, cross-platform, and modular, our python tools are thought for quick control of complex robotics creatures. Our software seemlessly integrate with simulated and real version of our robots.
  </p>

  <p>
    All softwares are open source and distributed under GPLv3 licenses.
  </p>

  <h3>Pypot library</h3>

  <p>
    A python library to control Poppy creatures:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Low-level access to motors and sensors - yet easily extendable to new types of devices.</li>
    <li>Creation of complex behaviors by combination of independent primitives.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Robot simulator</h3>

  <p>
    Poppy creatures are integrated in the v-rep simulator with a transparent
    switch from simulated to physical robots through pypot.
  </p>

  <h3>Creature specific repositories</h3>

  <p>
    Each creature has a specific software repository with basic configuration
    files and high-level behaviors. Anyone can contribute or create its own creature using our templated repositories.
  </p>

  <h3>Web control interface</h3>

  <p>
    A web control interface to remotely launch behaviours on Poppy creatures
    without needing to install anything on your computer.
