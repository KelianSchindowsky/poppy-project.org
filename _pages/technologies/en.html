    The Poppy platform develops open-source tools for rapid prototyping and
    flexible experimentation of robotic creatures. It addresses mechanics,
    electronics, and software.
  </p>
  <p>
    It targets the needs of a multidisciplinary community where researchers,
    teachers, artists, and robotic enthusiasts can share their work and ideas.<br>
    Poppy tools are designed to be modular, easy to use, and easy to integrate – providing
    a set of building blocks that can be easily assembled and reconfigured.

      <h3>Poppy Humanoid</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        Poppy Humanoid is our leading creature. It is aesthetic, modular,
        and parametric. From a single arm to the complete humanoid, this
        platform is actively used in labs, engineering schools, FabLabs, and
        artistic projects.

      <p>
        Poppy Torso is an humanoid robot torso meant to be used in contexts
        such as education, FabLabs or research projects.

      <h3>Poppy Ergo Jr</h3>
      </a>
      <p>
        Poppy Ergo Jr was first developed for an exhibition mixing art and
        science. With only 6 motors it is the perfect project to start.

  <h2>Modular technologies</h2>

  <h3>Hardware overview</h3>

  <p>
    Our major challenge is to make the robotic hardware cheap and modular so
    anyone can change the morphology of his/her robot to be adapted for the
    experience targeted.
  </p>

  <p>
    Of course, all this work is open source and distributed under Creative
    Commons BY-SA licenses.
  </p>

  <h3>3D Printed body</h3>

  <p>
    We use 3D printing to design Poppy creatures – it is a reproducible and cheap
    production technique that allows anyone to produce locally its own and
    customized parts. In addition, it removes usual manufacturing constraints
    from classical production techniques.
  </p>

  <h3>Modular actuation</h3>

  <p>
    Poppy creatures are based on modular smart-actuators called Robotis
    Dynamixel. They embed in a small form factor several features such as
    high-level control and a communication bus. They are commonly used in
    robotics and are available with multiple actuation power. Yet the project
    is open to new contribution for robot actuation.
  </p>

  <h3>Arduino electronics</h3>

  <p>
    We develop custom electronic board optimized for robotics needs. We want you
    to be able to add motors and sensors where you want. As a first step, we
    developed an Arduino compatible board; it features plenty of I/O and benefits
    from the Arduino community, but also includes new features, such as a USB HUB
    and the elements needed to control Dynamixel servos.
  </p>

  <h3>Software overview</h3>

  <p>
    The software developed in the Poppy project target to offer easy-to-use,
    cross-platform and modular tools so anyone can easily program and use both
    real and simulated robots.
  </p>

  <p>
    The software is open source and distributed under GPLv3 licenses.
  </p>

  <h3>Pypot library</h3>

  <p>
    A python library to control Poppy creatures:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Low-level access to motors and sensors (meant to be easily extendable to new types of devices).</li>
    <li>Creation of complex behaviors by combination of independent primitives.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Robot simulator</h3>

  <p>
    Poppy creatures are being integrated in the v-rep simulator with a transparent
    switch from simulated to physical robots through pypot.
  </p>

  <h3>Creature specific repositories</h3>

  <p>
    Each creature has a specific software repository with basic configuration
    files and high-level behaviors.
  </p>

  <h3>Web control interface</h3>

  <p>
    A web control interface to remotely launch behaviours on Poppy creatures
    without needing to install anything on your computer.
  </p>
