## Poppy, an open-source robotics platform based on 3D printing, is used as a tool for teaching.

With Poppy you can program robotics objects without needing to build the complete robot design beforehand. A wide range of possible educational activities including secondary school, higher education, various options and subjects can benefit from this tool.

The platform accessibility enables teachers to create and to share educational and collaborative projects that meet two key characteristics:

* Integration of **various technologies and methodologies**: 3D printing, programming, electronics, machine learning algorithms.
* Connections and **collaborations between different disciplines**: engineering, science, design, humanities, art.

Poppy Education aims to create, evaluate and disseminate pedagogical kits “turnkey solutions” complete, open-source and low cost, for teaching computer science and robotics.

### Why?

To help young people **to take ownership with concepts and technologies of the digital world**, and provide the tools they need **to allow them to become actors of this world, with a considerable socio-economic potential**.

### How?

**In collaboration** with teachers. Users and their needs are placed at the center of this project. The pedagogical tools Poppy will be **created directly with them and evaluated in real life** by experiments.

Poppy Education is based on the robotic platform poppy, from which it is possible to construct different robots, including:

* Poppy Humanoid is a robust and complete robotics platform designed for genuine experiments in the real world and can be adapted to specific user needs.
* Poppy Torso is a variant of Poppy Humanoid. It is a torso humanoid robot that can be easily installed on a table.
* Poppy Ergo Jr is a robotic arm. Solid and inexpensive, it is perfect to be used in class.

### Programmation

Poppy robots are easy to program. Different options are possible based on students level and teaching objectives.

#### Python

**Directly from a web browser**, using Ipython notebooks (an interactive terminal, in a web interface for the Python Programming Language).

#### Snap*!*

**The visual programming system Snap*!***, which is a variant of Scratch. Its features allow **a thorough introduction of IT**.

#### Your favorite programming language

C ++, Java, Matlab, Ruby, Javascript, etc. thanks to a REST API that allows you to send commands and receive information from the robot with simple HTTP requests.

### Simulation

Poppy Humanoid, Torso and Ergo robots can be simulated with the free simulator V-REP. It is possible in the classroom to work on the simulated model and then allow students to run their program on the physical robot.
