# About

## Philosophy

The Poppy project is a **community-centered** robotic project. It targets the needs of a multidisciplinary community where researchers, teachers, artists, and robotic enthusiasts can share their work and ideas.

Poppy tools are designed to be modular, easy to use, and easy to integrate â€“ providing a set of building blocks that can be easily assembled and reconfigured.


Poppy places the people creativity and bottom-up project emergence at the heart of the robotic development.

Through its accessibility and its openess, the Poppy project contributes to make the futur technologies more democratic and transparent.

## History

The Poppy project is born in 2012 in the [Flowers laboratory](https://flowers.inria.fr/) at [Inria Bordeaux Sud-Ouest](http://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux).
It was initiated during [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://github.com/matthieu-lapeyre)'s PhD Thesis surpervised by [Pierre Yves Oudeyer](http://www.pyoudeyer.com/). At the beginning, the development team was composed by [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://github.com/matthieu-lapeyre) (mechanics & design), [Pierre Rouanet](https://github.com/pierre-rouanet) (software) and [Jonathan Grizou](http://jgrizou.com/) (electronics).

This project is initially a fundamental research project financed by [ERC Grant Explorer](http://erc.europa.eu/) to explore the role of embodiement and morphology properties on cognition and especially on the learning of sensori-motor tasks.
